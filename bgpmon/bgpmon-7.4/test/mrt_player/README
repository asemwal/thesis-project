The MRT Player is designed to validate MRT data files and send the files to BGPmon 

Uses of the player include:

- converting a collection of MRT update files into XML by sending the files to BGPmon

- validating an MRT file and identifying files with corrupt MRT data

The player also comes with an optional helper called mrtReceiver.   mrtReceiver simply
listens for connections from an mrtPlayer and writes any received messages to a file.   
This can be helpful for debugging mrtPlayer issues or simply validating MRT files.

Examples:

To send all the January 2011 update files from RouteViews6 to a BGPmon running on localhost 127.0.0.1:

  mrtPlayer -server 127.0.0.1 -p 50000 -collector route-views6 -year 2011 -month 01

To detect any corrupt files in the November 2011 collected by RouteViews at KIXP,

  start an mrtReceiver so to receive the update data
  mrtReciver  

  send the update data to the mrtReceiver and display verbose output
  mrtPlayer -v -collector route-views.kixp -year 2011 -month 11

  if mrtPlayer encounters any invalid messages,  it will halt on that message,  explain the error,
  identify the file, and locate the approximate byte and message in the file where the error occurred.
