1) mrtPlayer should better sanity check the command line input.   it should also list the possible 
   collector names in the usage message.   - just trivial coding and checking in parseCommandLine

2) mrtPlayer should have an option to just verify files,  not send them out over the TCP connection.
   if the option is set,just have connectBGPmon do nothing and return null for a socket and
   if the option is set,  don't call the only send line in readAndSendMRT.

3) mrtPlayer should allow more precision in the interval so a user can select only a single day or 
   single hour or even range of minutes.   just add checking to the main loop to skip any update 
   file not in the desired range.

4) mrtPlayer should add a -r option to send an initial RIB table before sending the updates.  for example,  
   if the user specifies January 2011 from collector route-views6, mrtPlayer should first download and 
   send the first MRT table from January 1, 2011.   this is a more substantial change
