[mrtfile] - location of MRT file
[dir]     - data output folder

For example:  mrtanalyzer -f updates.20110916.1715  ~/Development/bgpmon-dev/test/mrt_harness/data

OUTPUT:

peerlist.txt - file that has IP addresses of peers from MRT file.
'IP'_table.txt - table with routes for peer with 'IP' address.
