test/unit_test_input
This directory is meant to hold all of the input that is needed for unit tests.
Unit tests are those that are run using CUnit using the make test target in the Makefile.

There should be a directory's for each different protocal that is being tested.
For instance the mrt directory contains mrt messages.
Thus far the mrt directory has adopted the naming convention  mrt.[type].[subtye]
There are variations within each of those and so as we expand the tests the naming conventions
need to become more specific.
