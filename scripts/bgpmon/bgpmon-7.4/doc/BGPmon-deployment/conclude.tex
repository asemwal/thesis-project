\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}

Overall, we believe BGPmon represents an important change in how BGP route monitoring is accomplished in the Internet. We hope that the addition of BGPmon will make it much simpler for researchers and operators to obtain BGP data and the addition of widely available real-time BGP data will lead to the development of new tools for better understanding Internet routing.
